=============
_top-down zombie survival fun._

----------

Zombit is an 8-bit retro style game that takes place in a dark office complex. Fight off zombies as you push through rooms to collect weapons and loot. Scavenge for supplies, escape the horde, or make your last stand in one of three game modes. Powerful randomized weapons will help you fight off more zombies.

Currently the game is in **beta** with no set release date.  Not all of the features are done yet!  However, I encourage you to check it out in its current state and offer feedback!
