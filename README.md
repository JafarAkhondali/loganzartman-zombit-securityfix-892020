_top-down zombie survival fun._

Zombit is an 8-bit retro style game that takes place in a dark office building. Fight off zombies and push through
floors of the building as you rack up a higher score to compete with the world. Chests and upgrades can be found around
the rooms. Upgrades will help you fight off more zombies with higher-powered weapons and nice stat boosters.
